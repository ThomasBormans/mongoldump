# mongo(l)dump #
Script (for noobs) which helps you exporting and importing MongoDB databases.

## What does the script do for me? ##

* Export:
    * Export single database.
    * Provide (optional) export path. If empty, the current working directory will be used.
* Import:
    * Import single database.
    * Overwrite data in the database if it already exists.

## How do I use the script? ##
```sh
$ chmod +x mongoldump.sh # Make script executable
$ ./mongoldump.sh # Run script and follow the questions in the terminal
```

## When should I create an issue? ##

If you find a bug in one of these repositories, have trouble following the documentation or have a question about the project – create an issue! There's nothing to it and whatever issue you're having, you're likely not the only one, so others will find your issue helpful, too.

## Can I open a pull request? ##

If you're able to patch the bug or add the feature yourself – fantastic, make a pull request with the code! Be sure you've read any documents on contributing. Once you've submitted a pull request the maintainer(s) can compare your branch to the existing one and decide whether or not to incorporate (pull in) your changes.
